# Recipe Notebook




The goal of the app is to 
    -- Create and save recipes, including ingredients and procedures
    -- Categorize by meal, cuisine type, and other criteria
    -- Comment on and improve steps, ingredients, and other aspects of recipe

The app uses Sinatra, ActiveRecord, and Rack to handle CRUD requests, and Materialize CSS to handle front-end styling

The app is locally hosted







Potential future additions:

    Comments: Notes in the margins of ingredients/steps to modify recipe
    Import: Web-scraper to import recipe from website given the URL
